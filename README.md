# Scripts

Some scripts I've written, modified, or stolen for doing various things.

All licenses that came with the scripts have been preserved.


## Installation

To install these, just move them to a directory that's on your `$PATH`, like `/usr/local/bin/`, or `~/bin`.

The following command will install all the scripts in this repo.

```bash
$ mv *.sh ~/bin/
```
