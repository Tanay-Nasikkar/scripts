# Scripts

Some scripts I've written, modified, or stolen for doing various things.

All licenses that came with the scripts have been preserved.

## Installation

To install these, just move (or symlink) them to a directory that's on your `$PATH`, like `/usr/local/bin/`, or `~/bin`.

The following commands will install all the scripts in the top level of this repo.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/alichtman/scripts.git && cd scripts
$ chmod +x *.sh
$ mv *.sh /usr/local/bin/
# Test for a successful installation by running the following command
$ year-progress.sh
```
